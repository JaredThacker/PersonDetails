# Iterating an array of `Person` objects
* **Objective:**
    * To concatenate the details of `Person` objects by iterating an array  

* **Purpose:**
    * To demonstrate practical understanding of `while`, `for`, and `for each` loops.

* **Getting started:**
    * The [PersonHandler](https://github.com/Zipcoder/CR-MesoLabs-Loops-PersonDetails/blob/master/src/main/java/com/zipcodewilmington/PersonHandler.java) class has 3 [method stubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub) to be completed.
        * The methods contain line-by-line comments to guide you through the process.
    * Ensure all tests cases pass successfully.

Do _ObjectsOne_ and _TestingPersonClass_ labs first. (well, unless you __want__ to make things harder. Why?)
